# vRP Self Storages
Locations where players can store items, with configurable price per item stored.


# Dependencies
 - https://github.com/glitchdetector/fivem-blip-info

#### Does not include permission and item definitions, but these are the following used by the script:

## Items:
`storage_card`, allows free storage of items (consumable)

## Permissions:
`omni.storage_override`, allows entry in any storage, regardless of permission requirement
`premium.storage_features`, allows for item movement to nearby vehicles (may not work with vanilla vRP)
`transfer.self_storage`, allows transfer from your to another players storage

# Note
This was custom made for Transport Tycoon's requirements, Transport Tycoon runs a heavily modified vRP and thus not all functionality may work as intended on base vRP.
